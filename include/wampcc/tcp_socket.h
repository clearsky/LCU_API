/**
Represent a TCP socket in both server and client mode.

A socket is created and operated in either server mode or in client mode. Using
it in server mode involves use of the listen() method; using it in client mode
involves use of connect().

The owner of a tcp_socket must take special care during its deletion.  It is
undefined behaviour to invoke the tcp_socket destructor via the internal wampcc
IO thread for an instance not in the closed state.

There are three approaches to achieve safe deletion of a tcp_socket:

1. Invoke the destructor on a thread other than the wamp IO thread. It is always
   safe to delete a tcp_socket this way, no matter what the current state of the
   instance.  The destructor will, if necessary, advance the state to closed and
   perform any wait required for closed to be reached.

2. Manually ensure the instance has reached the closed state before calling the
   destructor.  The close of a tcp_socket is initiated by calling close().  Once
   initiated the socket will transition to the closed state asynchronously.  The
   caller can wait for closed to be reached by waiting on the future returned by
   close() or closed_future(). Such a wait must not be performed on the wampcc
   IO thread, since it is the IO thread that performs the internal work required
   to advance the state to closed. The method is_closed() tells if the closed
   state has been reached.

3. Delete the socket asynchronously using a callback associated with the close
   operation.  The close(on_close_cb) method initiates close of a tcp_socket;
   once the closed state has been achieved the user callback is invoked (via the
   wampcc IO thread).  Now that the close state has been reached the instance
   can be safely deleted during the callback.

In addition to these strategies a tcp_socket_guard can be used to ensure the
correct disposal of a tcp_socket that has a scoped lifetime. The guard will
detect if an unclosed tcp_socket is about to be deleted on the wampcc IO thread,
and in such situations will intervene to delete the instance via asynchronous
callback.

Using a tcp_socket_guard with a scoped tcp_socket prevents accidental unsafe
deletion.  Unintended deletion typically occurs when an exception is thrown that
leads to scope exit, and with it the deletion of associated local objects.
